Refactoring
Due to rust-analyzer's semantic understanding of your source code, it can also provide smart renames, across your Rust files. With your cursor on a variable, select Rename Symbol from the context menu, Command Palette, or via F2.

The rust-analyzer extension also supports other code refactorings and code generation, which the extension calls Assists.

Here are just a few of the refactorings available:

Convert if statement to guarded return
Inline variable
Extract function
Add return type
Add import
Formatting
The Rust toolset includes a formatter, rustfmt, which can format your source code to conform to Rust conventions. You can format your Rust file using ⇧⌥F or by running the Format Document command from the Command Palette or the context menu in the editor.

You also have the option to run the formatter on each save (Editor: Format On Save) or paste (Format On Paste) to keep your Rust code properly formatted automatically while you are working.
